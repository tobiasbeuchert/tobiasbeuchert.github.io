	    <h2>Accreting Black Holes and Neutron Stars</h2>
	    <span class="byline">On the most efficient and energetic power plants in the Universe</span>
	  </header>
	  <p>I am involved in studying the probably
          most extreme objects: black holes and neutron stars that
          attract matter from their surroundings. The bottom part of this page is rather technical. Here, I
	  want to bridge to the general public and let everyone access
	  the fascinating science we are pushing forward. With these
	  information on hand, it will be easier to understand the
	  condensed information presented below.</p>
	  
	    <div id="left-align" class="popup" onclick="MyShowFunct_bh()" style="margin-bottom: 1em">What are black holes and neutron stars?</div>
	  
          <div id="cont_bh">
	    <p>Black holes and neutron stars gather a lot of mass at
          very little space. Both can result from the
          <b>collapse</b> of a massive star at the end of its
          lifetime. During such a collapse, several processes that
          would keep matter in shape are overcome and a <b>super-dense
          configuration of matter</b> is formed. Neutron stars can be
          said to be the last stable (and most dense) configuration of
          matter known. They are about as massive as our sun but
          measure only tens of kilometers in diameter. In other cases,
          massive stars collapse all the way to black holes.</p>
	    <p>In black holes, the entire mass is found in one
          "singularity". The <b>"size" of a black hole</b> is pure
          definition and not the size of any structure - it is the
          (gravitational) radius at which nothing, not even light can
          escape the steep trough of <b>space-time</b> formed by the
          super-dense black hole. We call both neutron stars and black
          holes <b>"compact objects"</b>.</p>
	    <p>When we neglect time, an <b>analogy of space</b> is a
          stretched sheet. Now, let's compare two objects of the same
          mass: a heavy marble (the black hole) and porous Dutch bread
          (our sun). The marble will curve the sheet deeper than the
          bread. Still, both will curve the sheet the same way towards
          its outer edge. A lighter marble thrown onto the sheet will
          therefore draw circles the same way around both central
          objects. <b>Curvature of space</b> is exactly what causes
          gravitational attraction. Likewise, Earth will orbit our sun
          the same way it would orbit a black hole of the same
          mass. The story changes only when an observer approaches the
          black hole very closely and experiences the localized and
          much deeper (and steeper) curvature of space-time (our sheet
          plus time as fourth dimension). Black holes therefore only
          have a very small area of influence. Here, all the
          fascinating effects come to play. Light, for example, has to
          follow space-time just as a marble on a curved sheet. Close
          to a black hole, light from your flashlight may come back to
          you and you may also see yourself from behind. But be aware
          of the extreme tidal forces that will stretch everything
          like a spaghetti. The steeper the sheet (or space) is
          curved, the stronger the tidal force. </p>

	  <div id="left-align" class="popup" onclick="MyShowFunct_accr()" style="margin-bottom: 1em">What happens when mass falls onto compact objects?</div>	  
	  
	  <div id="cont_accr">
	  <p>Only the environment of black holes (and neutron stars)
          makes them the <b>most efficient and energetic power plants
          in the universe</b>. Everything that formed anywhere in the
          Universe has angular momentum and follows trajectories
          around a center of mass. If there is matter close to a black
          hole with angular momentum, it will thus spiral around the
          heavy central mass just like planets around their central
          star(s). This is true for black holes at all sizes and
          masses. Matter around the largest black holes of millions to
          billions of solar masses forms the centers of huge galaxies
          like our Milky Way. Matter around stellar-sized black holes
          may have originated from gas remaining after the explosion
          of the foregoing massive star.</p>
	  <p>Very close to the black hole, gas is assumed to be very
          dense. Friction can lead to an outward transport of angular
          momentum and therefore the formation of a disk. This disk can
          continuously feed the inner object with mass. Einstein's
          famous equation predicts that this mass is proportional to
          energy. During the <b>"accretion of matter"</b>, this
          <b>gravitational energy is released</b> via radiation across
          the electromagnetic spectrum and strong outflows of
          matter. The efficiency at which radiation is produced
          exceeds nuclear fusion by a factor of more than 14 and we
          can certainly call it the most efficient process to produce
          energy across the Universe. On Earth, however, we have
          limited possibilities to squeeze the energy contained in
          pure mass. For example, we burn it (one of our biggest
          problems), throw it somewhere, try to extract the kinetic
          energy carried by winds, or let reactions do their
          thing.</p>
          <p>Accretion onto compact objects is an <b>ubiquitous
          process in the Universe at all mass scales</b>. It is a
          process of gradual in-spiral and not the consequence of
          black holes sucking in their environment in
          free-fall. Galaxies, where their central black hole happens
          to accrete matter and thus releases heaps of energy, are
          called "Active Galaxies". Our Milky Way is not an Active
          Galaxy. Note that, on smaller scales, neutron stars can also
          attract matter from their surroundings. For them, this
          process can not last forever. After accumulating a certain
          mass, an explosion is triggered that may lead to the
          formation of a black hole. Black holes, however,
          can <b>merge and accrete matter over cosmological time
          scales</b> and reach extreme masses. Merging black holes
          (and neutron stars) were just recently found by detecting
          gravitational wave signals from these mergers with Earth
          itself as detector material.

	   <div id="cont_myresearch">
	     <p>My research focuses on a better understanding of
	  compact objects as cosmic power plants. To do so, me and my
	  colleagues try to picture the invisible. The size of a
	  supermassive black hole inside a distant galaxy is
	  comparable to the size of a bacterium on the moon, which is
	  much smaller than the best telescope could resolve. We
	  therefore use some tricks.  We study all forms of the
	  released energy to <b>infer the energizing processes very
	  close to the black hole</b>. We observe the light being
	  emitted from these systems from the lowest to the highest
	  energies (from the radio to the gamma-rays). The <b>energy
	  dependency of the light encodes valuable information</b> on the
	  processes we try to understand.  Matter that is thrown out
	  of these systems (the "exhaust"), however, can be observed
	  and imaged in many cases. The most extreme of these outflows
	  are <b>"jets"</b>. They emerge from the centers of Active
	  Galaxies and the environment of stellar-sized black holes
	  inside galaxies. Jets are remaining focused at extremely
	  large distances. They <b>accelerate matter to nearly the speed
	  of light</b>, which also produces radiation. We can for example
	  observe their strong radio light with large radio antennas
	       on Earth.

	      <h2>Active Galactic Nuclei</h2>
	    </header>
	    <p>Me and my colleagues have been observing the innermost
              structures of Active Galactic Nuclei. We push for
              exploiting the vast information contained in the entire
              electromagnetic spectrum and observe these systems with
              numerous facilities. Those are <b>radio telescope
              (networks)</b>, ground-based and space-borne
              observatories sensitive to the <b>optical, UV, and
              X-rays</b>, up to the highest energies in
              the <b>gamma-rays</b>. We performed <b>time-resolved
              X-ray spectroscopy</b> of a number of sources. By
              monitoring changes in the emitted X-ray spectrum, we can
              infer not only the physics intrinsic to these nuclei,
              but also their highly dynamical morphology. We have to
              use this approach, as the resolution of the best
              telescopes is by far not enough to image these compact
              environments around distant black holes. We compare our
              observations with <b>state-of-the-art spectral
              models</b> that describe the photoabsorbing effect of
              neutral and ionized material in and around these nuclei,
              general relativistic effects, and many more.  We
              published two dedicated case studies of the Active
              Galaxies <b>NGC 3227</b>

	      <h2>X-ray binaries</h2>
	    </header>
	    <p>In our <a href="https://www.seramarkoff.com">working
	    group</a> at the <a href="https://api.uva.nl/">Anton
	    Pannekoek Institute for Astronomy</a>, we are particularly
	    interested in <b>stellar-mass accreting compact
	    objects</b>. We are investigating accretion and feedback
	    as two processes that seem to be ubiquitous across a large
	    range of masses. In X-ray binaries, a compact object and a
	    star are orbiting each other. The star is loosing mass
	    onto the compact object, which released large amounts of
	    energy. I am particularly interested in systems, where the
	    compact object accretes matter at extreme rates, yet
	    leading to the most luminous but less well understood
	    objects known for that class, so-called <b>"Ultraluminous
	    X-ray Sources"</b>. We are interfacing observations and
	    cutting-edge theoretical work to get to the bottom of
	    these mysterious objects.  </p>

	      <h2>Outflows, Winds, and Jets</h2>
	    </header>
	    <p><b>Accretion and feedback are linked processes</b> in
	    accreting compact objects. As opposed to matter being
	    attracted, "feedback" describes everything being expelled
	    from these systems. At all mass scales of the central
	    compact object, we frequently observe <b>wide-angle
	    winds</b> of moderate to relativistic speeds
	    and/or <b>magnetically collimated streams ("jets")</b>
	    that accelerate matter to nearly the speed of
	    light. In <b><a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2018A&A...612L...4B/abstract">Beuchert
	    et al. 2018</a></b>, we studied the feedback of the <b>young
	    radio galaxy</b> PKS 1718-649 in order to find an
	    explanation for extended X-ray-emitting gas that has been
	    observed in this galaxy.<br>We are currently
	    investigating <b>host galaxy properties</b> of several
	    active galaxies to explain differing <b>jet
	    morphologies</b> with the (G)RMHD
	    code <a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/#abs/2018MNRAS.474L..81L/abstract">H-AMR</a>
	    developed in <a href="https://www.seramarkoff.com/">our
	    group</a>. <br>In an ongoing project, we investigate
	    stellar-mass accreting compact objects at their
	    extremes. <b>Ultra Luminous X-ray sources</b> are suspected to accrete at
	    the highest rates but are still not well understood. We use currently developed physical models to
	    describe the UV/X-ray electromagnetic spectrum of ULXs and their powerful feedback. We
	    seek to tighten our constraints by consulting the response of
	    the environment, i.e., the (ionization) properties of gas surrounding
	    these systems.
	    <br>During past research, me and my colleagues
	    investigated the morphology and physics of a jet stream
	    close to its origin. With
	    the <a href="http://www.physics.purdue.edu/MOJAVE/">MOJAVE
	    radio interferometer</a> we could spatially resolve gas
	    being accelerated into the <b>jet of 3C 111</b>
	    (<b><a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017arXiv171101593B">Beuchert
	    et al., 2017b</a></b>). The data also allowed us to study the
	    radio-polarization properties of shocked gas while
	    traveling downstream.</p>

	      to place our instruments in orbit around Earth.<br>  I
	      have been involved in <b>design studies of future X-ray

	      at the Dr. Remeis Observatory Bamberg, I studied the
